## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I built a portfolio website using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS to showcase projects and explore modern technologies efficiently. React's component-based structure enables modular development, while Vite's rapid build times and Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach ensure a seamless user experience and responsive design. This combination creates a dynamic platform for showcasing portfolios while providing opportunities to learn about cutting-edge web development techniques.
